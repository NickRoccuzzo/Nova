TO RUN THE PROJECT:

--> Run 'app.py' inside of /new_db_project
        --> this will use Dash's 'pages' to now utilize both /pages (for the actual pages the end-user will visit and use)
        --> Dash also uses /assets which includes a file called 'keyboard_nav.js' which allows for various keyboard-binds for quick navigation/customization
